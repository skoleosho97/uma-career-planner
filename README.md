# Umamusume Pretty Derby Career Planner
### Small webpage to help out planning out G1 races for a specific uma.
---
Simple project to show what races you can run. May expand to tackle long term uma builds, including parent and grandparent affinity building and CM preparation.

### Tasks
- [ ] Improve site design
- Using this project to improve my UI skillset. Current look was just to get something out published. Aiming to create something similar to how the in-game UI looks with some web-centric tweaks
- [ ] Clean up .tsx code
- Self-explanatory
- [ ] Add remaining global characters
- I do this manually but I'm looking into finding a data source that has global (and JP) information to ease the process.
- [ ] Add affinity calculation, parents, grandparents
- Have to find out what everyone's affinity is with who. Affinity will also affect how the site functions, since if you are going for max affinity, you'll want every uma to be running the same races, which is more to take into account.
- [ ] Make main career planning function work better
- I think the current career implementation is too much brute force. I'd like to explore how to make the filter process cleaner to read and understand.

### Update Log

###### 10/8
- Created some components to seperate code.
- Put all the constants in a single file for easier access.
- Reworked some site functions.
- Added a temporary page to work on while not messing with the current one because why not.
- Fixed GH Pages deployment.
